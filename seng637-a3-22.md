##### Defs, uses, and du-pairs

|               |                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **defs**:     | def(2) = {msg}              |
| **uses**:     | use(1) = {lower,upper}      |
|               | use(2) = {lower,upper}      |
|               | use(3) = {msg}      |
|               | use(4) = {lower}      |
| **du-pairs**: | for msg: (2,3) |
|               | for lower: (1,2),(1,4)|
|               | for upper: (1,2),(1,4)|


#### DU-pair coverage calculations per test case
| Variable | Def at node (n) | dcu(v,n) | dpu(v,n)  |
|----------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
|   lower  | Prior to function|        |   (1,2),(1,4)  |       
|   upper  | Prior to function|        |   (1,2),(1,4)  |
|   msg    |        2        |   (2,3)  |           |


| Test Case | Execution path | DU-pairs covered | CUc + PUc | All uses coverage % |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|---------------------|
|`lowerBoundShouldBeNegativeTen`| (1,4)            |                  |     (1,4)      |        33.33%             |
|`lowerBoundWithLargeRange`     | (1,4)            |                  |      (1,4)     |     33.33%                |
|`shouldThrowExceptionWhenLowerIsGreaterThanUpper`|     (1,2,3)       | (2,3)| (1,2),(2,3) | 66.66%

#### Total

Cuc + PUc = 3

CU +PU = 3

All-uses coverage = 100%
